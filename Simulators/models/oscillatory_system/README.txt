In this directory, you will find the oscillatory system that creates waves of
gene expression through a negative auto feedback with delay.  Three different
approximations are used for transcriptional repression, and demonstrate
how conditional and functional expressions can be used, as well as the ease
of switching between different levels of detail by changing which function
gets used.
